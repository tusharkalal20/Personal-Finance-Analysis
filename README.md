## Tools Used

## Data Source
Consolidated bank statements retrieved from the net banking portal form the primary data source, capturing the majority of financial transactions. While primarily sourced from banking transactions, it's important to acknowledge that not all expenses are accounted for, particularly those involving small-value payments made through platforms like Paytm or in cash.

Since the infromation presented in this project pertains to my personal financial data, important figures do no indicate actual income or expenses. This version of my analysis is made available as a public repository in attempt to showcase my skills and competency in data analytics.

## Data Loading
The data preparation stage involves loading the source data into Excel and identifying the underlying problems that may cause obstacles in the analysis and reporting. 
In this case, the personal financial statements, stored as PDF documents, were downloaded to the local storage from the bank's portal and loaded into Microsoft Excel.

It is evident that the raw data has some quality issues which need to be identified and adressed.

## Challenges 
1. Data Loading: Since financial statements are an important document, they are encrypted with a password to prevent from unauthorised use. Because of this encryption, Excel could not create a connection and  the load the data into a spreadsheet. To remediate this situation, I decrypted the file using a pdf tool.
2. Row-level: One of For me to be able to generate the reports that will help me answer my question, I need
3. Untracked Transactions: While most of the transactions were successfully loaded as per the 'Type' and 'Component' to describe the transaction, there were certain old transactions that could not be labeled

## Data Analysis


## Reporting Wireframing
I used Microsoft Power Point to create the basic structure and layout of how I want the dashboard to look like. This allowed me to evaluate the final outcome and decide if this .

1. Colours: I used [Coolors]([url](https://coolors.co/)) to choose my colors. Coolors is great tool to automatically generate color palettes.
2. Fonts:
   - Dashboard Title - Tableau Semibold - 22 px
   - Chart Titles - Tableau Regular - 10 px
   - Chart Text - Tableau Book - 8 px
4. Containers: 
5. Whitespace: Whitespaces have been attempted to be used effectively to show grouping    
6. Gridlines: 
7. Padding:
   - Inner Padding - 10
   - Outer Padding - 10
