# Personal-Finance-Project

## Objective
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of my personal financial statements, shedding light on patterns in income, expenditure, and investments.

## Key Questions
Like most data analytics projects, there are certain key questions that I am seeking to answer through this exercise. Before working on the actual project, there is merit in laying out what I am trying to achieve out of this project. This will not only help in giving a direction but will also avoid any futile work and let me focus on what is most important. This way, the we know the end goal, hence it becomes much easier to figure out what steps can we undertake to find the answers to our most pressing questions. Below are a few questions I would like to get an answer to:

   - Total Expenditure
   - Total Savings
   - Total Investments

2. Income Analysis:

3. Trends:

   - Expenditure trends over time
   - Correlation between income growth and expense patterns

4. Monthly Expenditures:

   - Identification of peak and low expenditure months

## Tools
- Data Loading and Cleaning - Microsoft Excel
- Reporting Wireframing - Microsoft Power Point
- Data visualization - Tableau

## Data Source
My personal financial transactions took through a mix of both bank and cash. However, banking transactions comprised of a majority of these transactions, hence, the data source is consolidated bank statements which have been retrieved from netbanking portal.

Consolidated bank statements retrieved from the net banking portal form the primary data source, capturing the majority of financial transactions. While primarily sourced from banking transactions, it's acknowledged that not all expenses are covered due to transactions made through platforms like Paytm or cash for small-value transaction.

## Data Preparation
The data preparation stage involves understanding the file type and loading it into the desired tool. In this case, the personal financial statements, stored as PDF documents, have been downloaded from the bank's internet banking portal and loaded into Microsoft Excel.

P.S. Although this data is good enough to provide insights into my spending patterns, it is not exhaustive, as it excludes certain minor expenses made through Paytm or facilitated through cash as mentioned above. 

## Data Analysis


## Reporting Wireframing
I have used Microsoft Power Point to create the basic structure and layout of how I want the dashboard to look like. This allowed me to get a glimpse of how the final outcome will appear.
Below is a list of information that I as the dashboard user would like to see:

Colours - I used [Coolors]([url](https://coolors.co/)) to choose my colors. Coolors is great tool to automatically generate color palettes.
