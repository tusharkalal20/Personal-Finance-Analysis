# Personal-Finance-Project

## Objective
This Github documentation aims to demonstrate the end-to-end process of Personal Finance Data Analysis project, which is a comprehensive analysis of my financial statements, shedding light on my income, expenditure, and investments.

## Key Requirements
1. KPIs:
   - Total Income
   - Total Expenditure
   - Total Savings
   - Total Investments

2. Income Analysis:
   - Breakdown of Income by Different Sources
   - Income Trend over Time

3. Income AnalysisExpenditure Analysis:
   - Expenditure Trend over Time
   - Categorization of Expenses by Percentage and Amount

6. Investments:
   - Allocation of investments by Assets
   - Present Value of Investments

## Tools Used
- Data Loading and Cleaning - Microsoft Excel
- Reporting Wireframing - Microsoft Power Point
- Data visualization - Tableau

## Data Source
Consolidated bank statements retrieved from the net banking portal formed the primary data source, capturing most financial transactions. It should be noted that while the data is primarily sourced from banking transactions, not all expenses are accounted for, particularly those involving small-value payments made through digital platforms like Paytm or in cash.

Since the information presented in this project pertains to my personal and confidential information, not all figures are actual, for instance: income and some expenses. This version of the analysis, available as a public repository is to showcase my competency in working with data.

## Data Loading
The data preparation stage involved loading the source data into Excel and identifying the limitations of data that may cause obstacles in the analysis and reporting. 
In this case, the personal financial statements, stored as PDF documents, were downloaded to the local storage from the bank's portal and loaded into Microsoft Excel.

Below is a preview of how the data looks in one of the yearly statements:

As is evident, the raw data has some quality issues which need to be addressed.
- Unnamed Columns
- Null Values
- Date formatting
- Data Labelling: A key requirement to conduct the required analysis is to have the description of each transaction and categorize with 'Type' and 'Component'.
- Data Loading: Due to the confidential nature of financial statements, they are commonly encrypted with a password to prevent unauthorized access. This encryption, however, posed a challenge in establishing an Excel connection to the PDF files and loading the data into a spreadsheet. To address this issue, I utilized a PDF tool to decrypt the file, enabling the extraction and transfer of data into the spreadsheet.

## Inferences
**1. Observations on Income:**
- Analyzing the line graph, it is evident that my income exhibited growth starting in 2020, with a substantial increase in 2022.
- I initiated earning in 2021; thus, until that year, my income predominantly consisted of savings interest on the existing amount.
- The apparent decline in 2023 is attributed to the data capture being limited to June 2023, encompassing only half of the income for that year.
- The breakdown of income sources reveals that full-time salary constituted approximately 77% of the total income, followed by stipends at 18%, tutoring at 4%, and savings interest income at 0.8%.


**2. Observations on Expenditure:**
- Expenses experienced a moderate decline from 2019 to 2020, but they showed a continuous upward trend from 2020 onward, indicating a positive correlation between the increase in income and the rise in expenses.
- My primary areas of expenditure, constituting the majority of my spending, are as follows:
   - Insurance & Medical - 33% (A significant portion of this amount was allocated to an ear procedure, followed by family health insurance covering a two-year period).
   - Wedding – 16%
   - Utilities – 14% (encompassing groceries, society maintenance, internet, gas, telephone, and fuel)
   - Food – 9% (including expenses from both dining out and fast-food consumption)
   - The average monthly expenses amount to INR 16,000.
   - Insurance & Medical - 33% (A big chunk of this went into ear procedure followed by family health insurance paid for 2 years)


**3. Savings & Investments:**
   - Over the course of five years, a total of 70,000 INR was set aside for savings and investments, constituting a mere 8% of the total income. This figure is notably low and requires a substantial increase. Contributing factors to the modest savings and investments could be attributed to two main reasons:
      - Failure to allocate sufficient funds to investments.
      - Insufficient available funds for saving and investing.Failure to allocate funds to investments
      
Our analysis suggests that the lack of investments stems from high expenses, which consume 71% of the total income, leaving limited funds available for investment. Further investigation merits a comparison between essential and discretionary spending to identify potential areas for reduction.

Upon scrutiny, it is evident that 49% of the expenses are deemed necessary and unavoidable. However, a significant portion of the remaining expenses, such as those related to the wedding and frequent dining out, could have either been reduced or entirely avoided.
