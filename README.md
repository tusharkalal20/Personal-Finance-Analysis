# Personal-Finance-Project
This project aims to analyze my personal financial statements to understand patterns in income, expenditure and investing

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel - Data Sourcing and Cleaning
- Microsoft Power Point - Reporting wireframing
- Tableau - Data visualization

## Data Source
Financial transactions happen through a mix of both bank and cash. Since banking transactions comprised of a majority of these transactions, they data source is bank statements that in turn have been retrieved from banking portal.

## Data Preparation
In the data preparation stage we first understand the type of file we have our data stored and then figure out the best way to load it into our desired software. Since our data source is pdf documents of personal financial statements, I have downloaded the documents from the internet banking portal of the bank and loaded it into Excel.

## Data Analysis


## Reporting Wireframing
I have used Microsoft Power Point to create the basic structure and layout of how I want the dashboard to look like. THis allowed me to get a glimpse of how the final outcome will appear.
Below is a list of information that I as the dashboard user would like to see:

1. KPIs - Total Income, Total Expenditure, Total Savings, Total Investeed
2. My income trend over the past 2 years
3. Breakdown of the income by different categories
4. Expenditure trend by month over the period of last 2 years
5. Breakdown of the expenditure by different categories
