# Personal-Finance-Project
This project aims to analyze my personal financial statements to understand patterns in income, expenditure and investing

## Key Questions
Like most data analytics projects, there are certain key questions that I am seeking to answer through this exercise. Before working on the actual project, there is merit in laying out what I am trying to achieve out of this project. This will not only help in giving a direction but will also avoid any futile work and let me focus on what is most important. This way, the we know the end goal, hence it becomes much easier to figure out what steps can we undertake to find the answers to our most pressing questions. Below are a few questions I would like to get an answer to:

1. KPIs - Total Income, Total Expenditure, Total Savings, Total Invested

2. Breakdown of the income by different categories

3. My income trend over time

4. Monthly Expenditures - How me expenses changed over time (Which month I spent the most, the least, Average monthly expense)

5. Where did spend my money (Different categories by Percent as well as Amount)
   - Am I spending more on necessities/essentials or entertainment/leisure?

6. Where did I invest my money and what is the current investment value?
   - Did I invest enough as per the income?
   - Shall I focus more on investing moving forward?
   - Has my investments generated returns more than the inflation?

7. Has my expenses increased with income or decreased?


## Tools
- Microsoft Excel - Data Loading and Cleaning
- Microsoft Power Point - Reporting Wireframing
- Tableau - Data visualization

## Data Source
My personal financial transactions took through a mix of both bank and cash. However, banking transactions comprised of a majority of these transactions, hence, the data source is consolidated bank statements which have been retrieved from netbanking portal.

## Data Preparation
In the data preparation stage we first understand the type of file we have our data stored and then figure out the best way to load it into our desired tool. Since our data source is pdf documents of personal financial statements, I have downloaded the documents from the internet banking portal of the bank and loaded it into Excel.
